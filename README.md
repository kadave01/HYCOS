# HYCOS (`Hy`drogen `CO`mbustion in `S`upercritical CO<sub>2</sub>)

## About
This repository contains a MATLAB   model developed at the Technische Universiteit Delft for thermodynamic assessment of the HYCOS cycle which is a transcritical/supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle fueled by H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> combustion. This cycle is proposed for use in H<sub>2</sub> based energy storage and reconversion systems for distributed power generation/energy islands. 

More details about the HYCOS concept can be found in my [publication]()  and in my [MSc thesis report](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Aaaa684ff-d22c-4482-bb2e-bbbd74336ab1) available at the TU Delft repository.

## I/O format
When executing `main.m` ensure a valid `input.dat` file is available in the source folder. The script then generates `output.dat` file containing the evaluated performance parameter of the HYCOS cycle for the defined configuration. Any desired configuration of the HYCOS cycle can be analyzed by editing the parameters in the `input.dat` file. 

## Input file
The `input.dat` should contain the following thermodynamic parameters as individual line items. 
```
### Main variables
- Lowest cycle pressure [bar] i.e. compressor inlet pressure 
- Highest cycle pressure [bar] i.e. compressor outlet pressure
- Highest cycle temperature [K] i.e. turbine inlet temperature
- Lowest cycle temperature [K] i.e. compressor inlet temperature
### Other constants 
- PPTD [K] i.e. minimum permissible temperature difference between the hot and cold lines in the recuperator
- HEX pressure recovery ratio HP side [-]
- HEX pressure recovery ratio LP side [-]
- Combustor pressure recovery ratio [-]
- Isentropic efficiency of compression process [%]
- Isentropic efficiency of expansion process [%]
- Combustion efficiency [%]
- Number of intercooled compression steps [-]
- Maximum allowable blade metal temperature for turbine cooling model [K]
- Molar mass of CO<sub>2</sub> [g/mol]
- Molar mass of H<sub>2</sub>O [g/mol]
- Molar mass of H<sub>2</sub>  [g/mol]
- Molar mass of O<sub>2</sub>  [g/mol]
- LHV of fuel (H<sub>2</sub>)  [MJ/kg]
- HHV of fuel (H<sub>2</sub>)  [MJ/kg]

### Exit criteria and other variables
- Permissible error in PPTD calculation [-]
- Permissible error in mixture composition calculation [-]
```
### Important note
Ensure the order in which these parameters are provided is same as in the sample `input.dat` file in the source folder to avoid errors / generation of invalid results.
